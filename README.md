# Algorithmics

Preparing for exams is a chore, except when you can code the
material to be learned. Then it's actually quite fun.

Thus this project.

I will try to centralize a lot of what I go through overtime.
Some easy and some not-so-easy things. Will grow overtime 
I guess.

Most (at least some) of the stuff here is useless as it's
worse-tier implementations of standard library but that is
beside the point.
